<h1>All About Frogs</h1>

    <h1>The top 5 most poisonous frogs:</h1>
    <ol>
        <h2><li>Splash-backed Poison Frog</li></h2>
        <p>The secretion of a Splash-Backed Poison Frog can kill up to five humans at once. This deadly frog lives in Peru and Ecudor.<br> It is also referred to as the variable poison frog or Zimmermann's poison frog.</p>

        <h2><li>Phantasmal Poison Frog</li></h2>
        <p>This endangered frog originates from Ecuador and is currently endangered, being bred in captivity to save their species.<br> Its skin secretes Epibatidine which at high doses can cause paralysis, loss of consciousness, coma, and eventually death. The poison is created from its native diet of their native insects.</p>

        <h2><li>Kokoe Poison Dart Frog</li></h2>
        <p>The Kokoe Poison Dart Frog currently inhabits the Columbian forests.<br> Although it hasnt been documented as killing any humans, the poison that it secretes is highly toxic,<br> and is used by natives to rub on spearheads for a more effective means of hunting. Its poison is known to cause siezures, paralysis, and extreme pain and fever.<br> The Koekoe Poison Dart Frog is a threatened species and its numbers are declining.</p>

        <h2><li>Black Legged Dart Frog</li></h2>
        <p>Being the second most poisonous frog in the world, the Black-Legged Dart Frog (formally known as Phyllobates bicolor) is one of the largest poison dart frogs. Males can reach lengths of up to 45-50mm while some slightly larger females can be 50-55mm in length. The Black-Legged Dart Frog is highly toxic, and only takes just 150 micrograms of its poison to <strong>kill</strong> an adult human. People heat the frog over a flame to make its poison sweat out for hunting darts. As poisonous as the Phyllobates bicolor is, it requires chemicals found only within their wild foud sources such as insects. Captive-raised frogs, being fed what do not contain these chemicals, will not become toxic in any way.</p>

        <h2><li>Golden Poison Frog</li></h2>
        <p>The Golden Poison Frog is considered one of the most toxic animals on earth. A single Frog has enough venom to kill 10 grown men and has been known to kill animals just by having them step in the same place the frog has been. The frog has a poison called an Alkaloid poison and it covers the skin of the frog. Being in captivity and having a regulated diet makes in far less poisouness. They are currently listed as endangered :(.</p>
